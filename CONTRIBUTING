Some guidelines for contributing include:

1. use CamelCase please
2. A indent should be 4 spaces, like a tab on most UNIX systems
3. Test your code before pushing it, faulty code will be automatically rejected.
4. Mantain decent code quality, I can tolerate a lot, but stuff like using a for loop for check if a number is odd is unacceptable

Q&A:

Will be added when someone asks a question
